# CS50x 2022 

Harvard's CS50x is an introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web programming. Languages include C, Python, and SQL plus HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. 
> You can find the materials and more about the course [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x).

I created this repository to save all my solutions for the problems proposed on the course. Every exercise got the maximum score on submission!
As you can see, I didn't complete the course yet, but soon I will!

> If you're considering taking this course, I highly recommend you to do it. It's an amazing course and you'll not regret it.

## Academic Honesty
> Please try to solve the problems before taking a look at any of my solutions. Only then will you have the best use of the course.
