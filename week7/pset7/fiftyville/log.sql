    you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame."

    (2) Raymond: "As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute. In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow.
     The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket."
